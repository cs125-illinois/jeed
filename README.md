Jeed is a speedy Java and Kotlin in-memory compilation and execution toolkit.
Jeed can rapidly compile Java and Kotlin code and safely execute the resulting bytecode in a secure sandbox.
Jeed can also perform a wide and growing number of Java and Kotlin source code analysis tasks.

Jeed is heavily used by [CS 124](https://www.cs124.org), the CS1 course at the
University of Illinois.
An [online demo is also available](https://cs125-illinois.github.io/jeed/).
