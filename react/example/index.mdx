<Lead>

Jeed is a speedy Java and Kotlin in-memory compilation and execution toolkit.
Jeed can rapidly compile and analyze Java and Kotlin code and safely execute the resulting bytecode in a secure sandbox.

</Lead>

## What is Jeed?

Jeed was created to implement Java and Kotlin in-browser playgrounds—like the ones shown on this page.
We provide a
[reference server implementation](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/jeed/tree/master/server)
and
[frontend examples](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/jeed/tree/master/react) in the Jeed repository.
Our Jeed playground server backs playgrounds and interactive examples on both the
[CS 125](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/) and
[Joyful Kotlin](https://kotlin.cs.illinois.edu/) University of Illinois course websites.
To date we have executed almost a million Java and Kotlin examples.

Jeed is fast enough that a small number of servers can easily handle the load produced by a large class,
even when examples are used in class and so run by almost a thousand students near-simultaneously.
However, Jeed can also be used as a library for any application that needs to quickly and safely compile and
execute arbitrary Java or Kotlin code.

**You are welcome to use Jeed!**
We are happy to help, and would love to know what you are doing with our library.
We are also happy to accept [pull requests](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/jeed/pulls) with fixes or requests for new features.

Please feel free to experiment with the examples below to get a sense of what Jeed can do.
The contents of each editor will be saved using [`mace`](https://cs125-illinois.github.io/mace), another CS 125 project, but
the original examples can be recovered using the reset button.

## Java

Jeed can quickly compile and execute Java code:

<Example id="java_class_hello_world" tasks={["compile", "execute"]} path="Main.java">

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main() {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
  }
}
```

</Example>

While this is a simple example, you can also compile multiple Java files, control package availability at compile time,
choose the entrypoint for execution, and set many execution options.
Please see the [source documentation](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/jeed) for more details.

Jeed runs code in a sandbox, secured using both existing Java protection mechanisms and a bit of bytecode manipulation.
Default permissions and resource limits are minimal, but can be relaxed as needed.
And while we make no claims to perfection, Jeed includes a
[robust set of tests](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/jeed/tree/master/core/src/test/kotlin/sandbox)
against every possible escape and resource exhaustion attack that we could think of.
But perhaps you know of one that we missed?
Feel free to launch it using any of the examples on this page!

As an optimization, Jeed caches compilation results.
Currently this caching is fairly simple, meaning that even trivial whitespace changes will cause it to break.
However, for examples that are not editable or where you don't expect heavy editing, even this simple caching approach can be at least somewhat effective.

### Snippets

Full Java class examples can be intimidating for beginners.
To help bootstrap our CS1 class, Jeed includes a Java snippet mode, enabling compiling and executing snippets of loose code like this one:

<Example id="java_snippet_hello_world" tasks={["snippet", "compile", "execute"]}>

```java
System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
```

</Example>

Snippets can also include function and class definitions:

<Example id="java_snippet_example" tasks={["snippet", "compile", "execute"]}>

```java
public class Example {
  public String name = "";
  public Example(String setName) {
    name = setName;
  }
  public String toString() {
    return name;
  }
}
void greeting(Example example) {
  System.out.println(example);
}
greeting(new Example("Ben"));
```

</Example>

Our snippeting approach is based on a straightforward transformation into a valid Java class.
As you would expect, it has limitations, but serves us well bootstrapping students to the point where they are ready to work with complete class files.

### `checkstyle`

Jeed can run [`checkstyle`](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) on sources, usually as a stage in the compilation and execution pipeline.
(Yes, we do this for our CS1 students.
They learn to love it, and produce code that is easy for our staff to read and correct.)
Here we configure Jeed to fail the build if `checkstyle` reports any violations:

<Example
  id="java_checkstyle_class"
  tasks={["checkstyle", "compile", "execute"]}
  jeedArguments={{ checkstyle: { failOnError: true }}}
  path="Main.java"
>

```java
public class Main {
  // checkstyle would like you to add some whitespace here...
  public static void main() { System.out.println("Hello, Java!"); }
}
```

</Example>

Currently `checkstyle` is configured on a per-server basis, but with a bit more work could be configured on a per-build basis.

### Cyclomatic complexity

Jeed can compute [static cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) of Java snippets and source code.
Complexity values are computed for each method and aggregated into classes.
For our CS1 course we provide use complexity to encourage students to write concise and clean code by providing a small number of
submitting a solution with complexity within delta of a reference solution.

<Example
  id="java_complexity_snippet"
  tasks={["snippet", "complexity", "compile", "execute"]}
  complexity
  maxOutputLines={32}
>

```java
int complicated(int which) {
  if (which < 0) {
    return 0;
  } else if (which < 1) {
    return 1;
  } else if (which < 2) {
    return 2;
  } else if (which < 3) {
    return 3;
  } else {
    return 4;
  }
}
System.out.println(complicated(0));
System.out.println(complicated(1));
```

</Example>

### Complete Server Response

Most of the examples on this page are configured to display output similar to what would be produced by the equivalent command-line tool.
However, Jeed returns a large amount of information about what happened during each build.
Here's an example showing the complete response returned to the client, which includes information about each step of the build process.
We use a snippet configured to run `checkstyle` and complexity analysis to show all of the steps that Jeed is currently
capable of performing on Java code.

<Example
  id="java_complete_output"
  tasks={["snippet", "checkstyle", "complexity", "compile", "execute"]}
  complete
  maxOutputLines={32}
>

```java
System.out.println("Let's produce a complete response!");
```

</Example>

## Kotlin

By default

<Example id="kotlin_hello_world" tasks={["snippet", "kompile", "execute" ]}>

```kotlin
println("Hello, Kotlin!")
```

</Example>
